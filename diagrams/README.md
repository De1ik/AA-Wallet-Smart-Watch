# Diagrams

Visual assets used across the documentation and presentations.

- `delegated-kernel-architecture.png` — high-level system architecture (mobile, server, kernel wallet, EntryPoint).
- `delegated-installation-sequence-diagram.png` — step-by-step delegated key installation and sync flow.
- `kernel-wallet-diagram.png` — component interaction: kernel wallet, CallPolicy, delegated keys, and EntryPoint.
- `ios-wearos-security.png` — security comparison and design constraints for iOS vs WearOS in the context of delegated keys.

These files are referenced from the root `README.md` and other docs using centered `<img>` tags so that they can be easily replaced with updated versions.***
